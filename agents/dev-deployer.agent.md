@dev-deploy-agent

Handles builds and deployments to your local dev environment. Keep it locked down: only deploy to dev environments and require explicit approval. Give it build commands and deployment tools but make the boundaries very clear.

    What it does: Runs local or dev builds, creates Docker images  
    Example commands: npm run test
    Example boundaries: Only deploy to dev, require user approval for anything with risk
